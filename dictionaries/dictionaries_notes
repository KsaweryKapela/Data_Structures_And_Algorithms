Dictionary = [unordered, changeable, indexed]

{key: value}

index = keys - don't have to be integer. Can be any type.

Dictionaries:
             can be seen as associative arrays,
             use hash tables = key-value lookups,
             values are stored in arrays,
             [keys, arrays, hash_function]

collusion: when different elements get placed on same index.
           fix: they get put there as linked list.
